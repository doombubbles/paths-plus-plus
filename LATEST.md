- Fix custom upgrade containers not appearing for tier 5+ upgrades on towers with paragons
- When Paths++ and Paragon upgrades overlap for a tower, you can right click on the upgrade to swap which one is showing
  - The "Paragon Overlap Default" setting controls which is the one it starts off as showing, with Paths++ being the default
- Improved upgrade screen visuals for non 16x9 aspect ratios
- `PathPlusPlus.ValidTiers` can now override Ultimate Crosspathing when Balanced Mode is on, if the modder so desires
- Added `NeedsConfirmation`, `ConfirmationTitle` and `ConfirmationBody` overrides for `UpgradePlusPlus`s that work like they do for `ModUpgrades`s
- Added `PathPlusPlus.OnUpgraded` and `UpgradePlusPlus.OnUpgraded` overrides to perform effects when upgrades are bought
  - The `BloonsTD6Mod.OnTowerUpgraded` hook will also be called for your mod's own Paths++ upgrades
